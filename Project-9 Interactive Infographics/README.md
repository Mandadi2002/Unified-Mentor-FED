# 📖 Project Overview:

The Interactive Media Infographics web app is designed to showcase real-time-like data analytics across four major information and communication platforms:

This interactive dashboard allows users to explore and compare data metrics such as reach, audience engagement, viewer/listener counts, and performance trends through dynamic visual elements. The goal is to make data-driven decisions easier and more engaging for media analysts, marketers, and researchers.

# 🎯 Objectives:
- To present multi-channel media data through an interactive and engaging UI.

- To allow cross-platform performance comparison using frontend-only technologies.

- To strengthen frontend development skills with real-time interactivity and responsive design.

- To simulate an analytical dashboard experience.

# ✨ Key Features:
**🔘 Platform Sections:**

- Social Media: Followers, Engagement, Click-through rate

- TV: Viewership ratings (TRP), prime-time analytics

- Radio: Listener count, average duration per listener

- Newspaper: Circulation, readership, region-wise distribution
