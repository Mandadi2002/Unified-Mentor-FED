- Scroll animations

- Theme toggle (light/dark mode)

- Form validations (optional)

- Section highlight on scroll (scrollspy effect)

# ✅ Future Enhancements:
- Add language toggle for multilingual support.

- Integrate with EmailJS or Formspree to make contact form functional.

- Add typing effect for the heading intro.

- Use localStorage to remember user theme preferences.

- Convert to a PWA (Progressive Web App) for offline access.

# 📚 Conclusion:
This project helped me practice and implement key concepts of frontend development while also building a personal branding tool. The interactive resume not only highlights my skills, projects, and certifications but also demonstrates my ability to create modern, responsive, and engaging web experiences using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
