# 📌 Project Title:
#Recipe Book Web Application

# 👨‍💻 Developed By:

Unified Mentor - Front - End Development Internship

# 🛠️ Technologies Used:
Frontend: **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla JS)**

Design Tools: Google Fonts, Font Awesome (optional)

# Version Control: Git & GitHub

# 📖 Project Overview:
The Recipe Book Web App is a simple and user-friendly application where users can browse, search, and view recipes in a clean interface. It is designed as a static web application using core frontend technologies with no backend. Users can view details like ingredients, cooking steps, and preparation time for various recipes.

# 🎯 Objectives:
To create a responsive and interactive interface for displaying recipes.

To allow users to search recipes dynamically using keywords.

To practice DOM manipulation and event handling using JavaScript.

To improve skills in frontend development and UI/UX.

# ✨ Key Features:
Homepage with a list of recipes displayed in cards.

**Search Functionality** – users can search for recipes by title or ingredient.

**Recipe Details** – clicking on a recipe shows full details including:

Ingredients

Steps

Image

Estimated cooking time

**Responsive Design** – works well on desktops, tablets, and mobiles.

**User-Friendly UI** – clean layout with hover effects and transitions.

# 💡 How It Works:
The **HTML** file contains the basic structure and layout of the web page.

The **CSS** file styles the UI including layout, cards, buttons, and transitions.

**JavaScript** dynamically fetches and renders recipe data, handles search input, and updates the DOM accordingly.

# 📷 Screenshots:
(Add screenshots of your homepage, recipe detail page, and mobile view here.)

# ✅ Future Improvements:
Add a feature to filter recipes by category (e.g., veg, non-veg, dessert).

Include favorites/bookmark functionality using local storage.

Implement a form for users to add new recipes.

Use local storage or IndexedDB for persistent data without backend.

Convert to a PWA (Progressive Web App) with offline support.

# 📚 Conclusion:
This project helped enhance my skills in frontend development, especially in DOM manipulation, layout design, and responsive UI building. It also introduced the concepts of event handling and real-time search filtering. The recipe book is a great beginner-to-intermediate project showcasing a good mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
