# Testing with The BODMAS Rule:
  
The BODMAS rule is a fundamental principle in mathematics that dictates the order of operations to be followed when solving expressions involving multiple arithmetic operations. The acronym BODMAS stands for Brackets, Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction

**Key Principles of BODMAS**

Brackets (B): Solve expressions within brackets first. This includes parentheses (), curly braces {}, and square brackets [].

Orders (O): Evaluate exponents and roots, such as squares and square roots.

Division (D): Perform division operations from left to right.

Multiplication (M): Perform multiplication operations from left to right.

Addition (A): Perform addition operations from left to right.

Subtraction (S): Perform subtraction operations from left to right.

**Example Calculation Using BODMAS**

Let's solve the expression: 3 + 2 * 4 - (6 / 3)
