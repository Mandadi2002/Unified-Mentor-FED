    <h1>Accessibility in HTML, CSS & JavaScript: Building Inclusive Web Experiences</h1></br>

â€œThe power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect".</br>
â€“ Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web</br></br>

In today's world, building websites isn't just about aesthetics and functionality â€” it's also about making sure everyone can access and 

interact with your content. Thatâ€™s where web accessibility comes into play.</br>

Letâ€™s explore how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be used to create inclusive and accessible web experiences for users of all abilities.</br></br>

<b>ðŸ”· 1. Semantic HTML: The Foundation of Accessibility</b></br>

Semantic HTML is the first step to ensuring accessibility. It means using the correct HTML tags for their intended purpose, which helps screen readers and assistive technologies understand the content.</br></br>


 <b>ðŸŽ¨ 2. Accessible CSS: Styling with Care</b></br>

CSS itself doesnâ€™t create accessibility issues, but poor design choices can.</br></br>

<b>âœ… Tips for Accessible CSS:</b></br>
>
<li>Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background.</li></br>

<li>Avoid using color alone to convey meaning.</li></br>

<li>Use :focus styles so users can navigate via keyboard.</li></br>

<li>Respect user's prefers-reduced-motion settings.</li></br>

<b>ðŸ§  3. JavaScript Accessibility: Donâ€™t Break What HTML Gives You</b></br></br>

JavaScript adds interactivity â€” but you must preserve or enhance accessibility, not reduce it.</br>

<b>âœ… JavaScript Accessibility Best Practices:</b></br></br>
<li>Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles, labels, and states carefully when native elements arenâ€™t enough.</li></br>

<li>Ensure all functionality is keyboard accessible.</li></br>

<li>Provide clear focus management after dynamic updates or modals.</li></br>

<li>Donâ€™t remove or alter native semantics unnecessarily.</li></br>

<b>ðŸ§© 4. Tools & Testing</b></br></br>

Use these tools to test and improve accessibility:

<li>Lighthouse (in Chrome DevTools)</li></br>

<li>axe DevTools</li></br>

<li>Wave Evaluation Tool</li></br>

<li>NVDA / VoiceOver for screen reader testing</li></br>

Also, keyboard-test your site: can you navigate everything using only the Tab and Enter keys?</br>

<b>ðŸš€ Final Thoughts</b></br>
Accessibility is not just a checklist â€” itâ€™s a mindset. By writing semantic HTML, designing with inclusive styles, and scripting responsibly with JavaScript, we can create experiences that are enjoyable and usable for everyone.
