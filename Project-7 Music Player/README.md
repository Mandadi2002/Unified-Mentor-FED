# 🎵 Project Report: Music Player Web Application
# 👨‍💻 Developed By:

Unified Mentor - Front-End Development Internship
# 🛠️ Technologies Used:
Frontend: **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla JS)**

Design Tools: **Font Awesome (for icons), Google Fonts**

# Version Control: Git & GitHub

# 📖 Project Overview:
The Music Player Web App is a lightweight and interactive media player that allows users to play, pause, and switch between songs using a visually appealing interface. Built using core web technologies, the player is designed to mimic the look and feel of modern music apps with features like a progress bar, song details display, and dynamic controls.

# 🎯 Objectives:
- To build a functional music player using only frontend technologies.

- To implement audio controls using the HTML5 <audio> element.

- To provide a seamless user experience through custom JavaScript logic and responsive design.

- To practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and real-time UI updates.

# ✨ Key Features:
- **Play/Pause Button** – Toggle playback of the current song.

- **Next/Previous Buttons** – Navigate between songs in the playlist.

- **Progress Bar** – Shows current position and allows seeking.

- **Song Info Display** – Displays song title, artist, and thumbnail.

- **Auto Play Next Song** – Automatically plays the next track when one ends.

- **Responsive Design** – Works well on all screen sizes (mobile/tablet/desktop).

├── **script.js**

├── **/music**

│  **└── song1.mp3, song2.mp3, ...**

├── **/images**

│   **└── song1.jpg, song2.jpg, ...**

# 💡 How It Works:
- The index.html file defines the layout with elements for the song cover, controls, and progress bar.

- The style.css file styles the layout with flexbox, animations, hover effects, and responsiveness.

**The script.js file:**

- Handles song switching logic

- Controls the audio playback (play(), pause(), currentTime, duration)

- Updates the progress bar in real time

- Adds event listeners for user interactions (clicks, audio events)

# ✅ Future Improvements:
- Add volume control slider.

- Implement a playlist view for browsing and selecting songs.

- Add loop, shuffle, and repeat functionalities.

- Integrate keyboard shortcuts for controls.

- Add localStorage support to remember last played song.

- Create a mini player view for multitasking.

# 📚 Conclusion:
This project allowed me to explore the power of the HTML5 Audio API and hone my skills in JavaScript-based UI interactions, responsive web design, and media control. It demonstrates how rich media applications can be built using just frontend technologies, without any external libraries or frameworks.
