# 🎮 Project Report: Memory Card Game

# 📌 Project Title:

**Memory Card Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
________________________________________
# 🧠 Objective:

The primary goal of this project is to develop an interactive and fun Memory Card Matching Game that enhances memory skills. The project aims to demonstrate the use of DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic implementation in JavaScript, along with visually appealing UI using HTML and CSS.

________________________________________
# 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:

•	HTML5 – For structuring the game elements (cards, layout).

•	CSS3 – For styling the game board, animations, and transitions.

•	JavaScript (Vanilla) – For implementing game logic, shuffling cards, handling user interactions, and tracking game state.

________________________________________
# 🎯 Features:

•	Grid of flip cards with matching icons or images.

•	Cards flip on click and reveal their content.

•	Two flipped cards are compared:

o	If they match, they stay flipped.

o	If not, they flip back after a short delay.

•	Score counter and move tracker.

•	Optional: Timer, reset button, and win message.

# 📐 Game Design & Flow:

**1.	Game Initialization:**

o	Array of card pairs (e.g., emoji or images).
o	Shuffle the array and render cards face down.

**2.	Card Flip Logic:**

o	On card click, reveal card.
o	If two cards are flipped:
	Check for a match.
	If matched, keep them visible.
	If not matched, hide them after a short delay.

**4.	Win Condition:**

o	Game ends when all pairs are matched.
o	Optionally display a congratulatory message or restart option.

**5.	Reset/Restart Functionality:**

o	Reload the game board.
o	Reset moves, timer, and matched cards.
